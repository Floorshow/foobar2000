# Foobar2000 Theme #

![](https://github.com/catlinman/foobar2000/blob/master/preview.png)

My complete Foobar2000 theme. A fork of CaTRoX that includes a lot of custom
panels, plugins and quality of life modules. The ultimate Foobar2000 theme.

*What's included?*

- Clean and dark interface with simple navigation.
- Simple rating and number of plays view.
- Searching and playing of YouTube videos.
- Cover art viewer and cover flow panel.
- Real time synced lyric viewer panel.
- Visualization and amplitude seek-bar.
- Highly customizable interface.

## Installation ##

If at any point you make changes to the interface and wish to reset: There's
an included layout file in the root directory called *Nekorox.fcl* which you
can load to reset everything to the way it was intended.

Once you have completed the steps below. Make sure to install the fonts
included in the *fonts* directory.

### Standard ###

If you have the standard non-portable version of Foobar2000 installed: make
sure to copy the *configuration* and *user-components* folders to your
application data directory located at *%appdata%/foobar2000*.

Additionally, copy the *themes* and *smoothbrowser* directories to your root
Foobar2000 installation directory.

### Portable ###

With the portable installation simply copy all the files in this directory to
you root Foobar2000 installation directory.
